Hello! This tutorial is to show you how to create books for oasis. First, go to pastebin.com and create a new paste. Make the first like be the book title. Then, go to the second line and put the author's name (probably your name.) Then, go to the next line and write away! Once it's done, create the paste and then while on the page containing the paste, click the button titled "Raw". Then, copy that URL from the URL bar. Inside oasis, open the downloader application and paste the url. Then, press enter and it will download your book to the files folder! Enjoy!
