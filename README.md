# oasis
Welcome to oasis, my first data-saving operating system!
## Installing
It's super simple. Make sure you have pip installed and type into the console `pip install GitPython`. Then, type `python` and paste `import requests as r; exec(r.get('http://bit.ly/get-oasis').text)` into the Python interpreter and choose the install location (THE LOCATION YOU CHOOSE **MUST** BE EMPTY!)
## What is oasis?
oasis is basically an operating system built in Python. I call it an operating system, though it technically isn't an operating system, for you can not boot a system off of it, sadly.
### What can you do in it?
Well, there are a bunch of applications you can run and do stuff with, some are for productivity, others just for fun. You can look at the wiki over at `https://github.com/TheLukeGuy/oasis/wiki` for the full list of applications.
##Requirements
###Python
Duh, you need Python because oasis was developed in Python.
###Simple-Crypt
Simple-Crypt can be obtained by getting Pip and typing into the console `pip install simple-crypt`.
##Opening/Resetting oasis
Open Terminal, type `cd [path to the oasis folder]`, then `python main.py`. To reset oasis and restart setup, make sure you are in the oasis directory, then type `python reset.py`.
