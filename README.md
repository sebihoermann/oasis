# tlgOS
Welcome to tlgOS, my first data-saving operating system! This is an awesome sequel to pyOS, which will soon be deleted from GitHub.
## More Information
For more information on tlgOS, visit thelukeguy.github.io/tlgOS. See you there! :)
##Requirements
###Pip
You need to have Pip installed in order for tlgOS to boot. You do not need Pip for Python 2.
###Pyfiglet
You need to install Pyfiglet by typing `pip install pyfiglet`, then `pip install --upgrade pyfiglet`.
###Python
Duh, you need Python because tlgOS was developed in Python.
##Opening/Resetting tlgOS
###Python 3
Running tlgOS with Python 3 installed on your computer is as easy as opening Terminal, typing `cd [path to the tlgOS folder]`, then finally type `python main.py`. To reset tlgOS and restart setup, make sure you are in the tlgOS directory, then type `python3 reset.py`.
###Python 2
Running tlgOS with Python 2 WILL use a very outdated version of tlgOS. First, in Finder, navigate to the tlgOS folder. Rename `main.py.bak` as `main.py`. Open Terminal, type `cd [path to the tlgOS folder]`, then `python main.py`. To reset tlgOS and restart setup, make sure you are in the tlgOS directory, then type `python reset.py`.
