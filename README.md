# tlgOS
Welcome to tlgOS, my first data-saving operating system! This is an awesome sequel to pyOS, which will soon be deleted from GitHub.
## More Information
For more information on tlgOS, visit thelukeguy.github.io/tlgOS. See you there! :)
##Opening/Resetting tlgOS
###Python 3
Running tlgOS with Python 3 installed on your computer is as easy as opening Terminal, typing `cd [path to the tlgOS folder]`, then finally type `python3 main.py`. To reset tlgOS and restart setup, make sure you are in the tlgOS directory, then type `python3 reset.py`.
###Python 2
Running tlgOS with Python 2 WILL use a very outdated version of tlgOS. First, in Finder, navigate to the tlgOS folder. Rename `main.py.bak` as `main.py`. Open Terminal, type `cd [path to the tlgOS folder]`, then `python main.py`. To reset tlgOS and restart setup, make sure you are in the tlgOS directory, then type `python reset.py`.
